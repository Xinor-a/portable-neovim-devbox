# Portable Neovim DevBox

A fully configured, portable Docker container with Neovim, Tmux, and modern CLI tools for developers.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a **fully configured Docker container** for a portable Neovim-based development environment. Whether you're setting up a new machine or working across multiple systems, this container ensures consistency and includes all the essential tools and configurations you need to be productive immediately.

### Key Benefits

- 🔄 Reproducible Neovim environment across any machine
- 📦 No local system pollution - everything runs in Docker
- 🚀 Quick setup - get coding in minutes
- 🛠️ Pre-configured with modern development tools

## 👥 Who This Is For

### ✅ Ideal For

- **Neovim enthusiasts** who want a consistent setup across multiple machines
- **Developers** working on different computers (work, home, servers)
- **Team leads** who want to standardize development environments
- **Students/Learners** exploring modern CLI-based development workflows
- **Remote developers** needing quick, reproducible environment setup
- **Terminal lovers** who prefer keyboard-driven workflows

### ⚠️ May Not Be Ideal For

- Beginners completely new to terminal/command-line interfaces
- Developers who prefer GUI-based IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Users who need Windows-native development tools (WSL may help them)
- Teams requiring specific IDE integrations not available in Neovim

### 📚 Recommended Background

- Basic understanding of:
  - Command-line navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`)
  - Text editing concepts (insert mode, normal mode)
  - Git basics (clone, commit, push)
  - Docker fundamentals (images, containers, docker-compose)
- Willingness to learn Neovim keybindings and modal editing

## ✨ Features

- **Nerd Fonts**: Patched fonts with icons and glyphs for enhanced terminal aesthetics and better visual feedback in your editor  
Pre-installed fonts are below(Needless to say, you can add more fonts as you like!):
  - [JetBrainsMonoNerdFont_v3.0.2](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/)
  - [MoralerspaceHWJPDOC_v2.0.0](https://github.com/yuru7/moralerspace)
- **Editor**: Pre-installed Neovim with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and custom keybindings for efficient coding  
See more about Neovim in [Repository of Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)!
- **Modern Prompt**: Starship prompt showing git status, language versions, execution time, and more at a glance  
The default configuration is based on [Gruvbox Rainbow Preset](https://starship.rs/ja-JP/presets/gruvbox-rainbow)  
You can customize as you like in `ProjectRoot/devenv/starship/starship.toml`!  
See more about Starship in [Repository of Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship)!
- **Terminal Multiplexer**: Tmux for managing multiple terminal sessions, split panes, and persistent sessions that survive disconnections. See more about Tmux in [Repository of Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)!
- **Real-time File Synchronization**: Unison for bidirectional file synchronization between `ProjectRoot/projects/` directory (mounted by name `/root/projects-master/` in the container) on the host and `/root/projects/` directory in the container, ensuring your projects stay up-to-date seamlessly.
